## project phases

> each phase reflects a step in my learning journey — from fundamentals to real-world apps.

- **python_basics – foundations**  
  core python fundamentals: terminal projects, basic algorithms, first oop exercises, and an introductory sqlite crud.

- **python_intermediate – intermediate & automation**  
  intermediate projects and automations, including object-oriented programming (oop), file handling, web scraping to csv/excel, and other data‑driven scripts.

- **python_hard – full applications** _(planned)_  
  complex projects involving databases, web scraping, and automation-focused solutions.

### python_basics:
  - `basic_projects/` – short cli scripts to practice logic, control flow, and data structures.  
  - `oop_projects/` – first steps with classes, objects, and small architectures.  
  - `sqlite_projects/` – simple crud in the terminal using python + sqlite for persistence.

### python_intermediate:
  - `web_scraping/` - examples involving http requests and html parsing using libraries like requests and beautifulsoup.  
    the goal is to experiment with different scraping techniques and data extraction flows.

## how to explore

1. pick a phase that matches your curiosity (start with `python_basics/`).
2. open the folder’s `readme.md` to see what each mini‑project does.
3. run the scripts locally, tweak the code, and break things on purpose to learn more.
