## Project Phases

> Each phase reflects a step in my learning journey — from fundamentals to real-world apps.

- **Phase 1 – Foundations**  
  Core Python fundamentals: terminal projects, basic algorithms, first OOP exercises, and an introductory SQLite CRUD.

- **Phase 2 – Intermediate & Automation** _(coming soon)_  
  Intermediate projects and automations, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, web scraping to CSV/Excel, and other data‑driven scripts.

- **Phase 3 – Full Applications** _(planned)_  
  Complex projects involving databases, web scraping, and automation-focused solutions.

- `basic_projects/` – Short CLI scripts to practice logic, control flow, and data structures.  
- `oop_projects/` – First steps with classes, objects, and small architectures.  
- `sqlite_projects/` – Simple CRUD in the terminal using Python + SQLite for persistence.

## How to Explore

1. Pick a phase that matches your curiosity (start with `python_phase_1/`).
2. Open the folder’s `README.md` to see what each mini‑project does.
3. Run the scripts locally, tweak the code, and break things on purpose to learn more.
