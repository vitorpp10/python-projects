# Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects organized into phases that reflect my learning journey.

## Project Phases

- **Phase 1** — Basic projects focusing on fundamental Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and simple algorithms.
- **Phase 2** (coming soon) — More advanced projects that will include Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and other intermediate topics.
- **Phase 3** (planned) — Complex projects involving databases, web scraping, and automation.

Each phase helps me deepen my Python skills progressively, with hands-on mini projects that challenge different programming concepts.
