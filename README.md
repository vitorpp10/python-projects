# Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects organized into phases that reflect my learning journey.

## Project Phases

- **Phase 1** — Core Python fundamentals: terminal projects, basic algorithms, first OOP exercises, and an introductory SQLite CRUD.
- **Phase 2** (coming soon) — Intermediate projects and automations, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, web scraping to CSV/Excel, and other data‑driven scripts.
- **Phase 3** (planned) — Complex projects involving databases, web scraping, and automation.

Each phase helps me deepen my Python skills progressively, with hands-on mini projects that challenge different programming concepts.
