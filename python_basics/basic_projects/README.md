## Mini Projects Overview

### **CPF Algorithm**
Implements the **CPF validation algorithm**, verifying if a Brazilian CPF number is valid.  
This project helped me understand **loops, conditions, and modular arithmetic**.

---

### **CPF Generator**
Generates **valid CPF numbers** using the same algorithm as the validation script.  
A great way to practice **functions, randomness**, and **input/output handling**.

---

### **List Market**
A **shopping list manager** that allows adding, removing, and displaying products interactively.  
It simulates a simple shopping system and strengthened my knowledge of **lists, dictionaries**, and **user interaction**.

---

### **Mini Calculator**
A console calculator supporting addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).  
Focused on **input validation**, **conditionals**, and **arithmetic operations**.

---

## **TryPassMe**
a simple python mini-game to guess the login and password. players have limited tries and get hints.

---

## **List Market 2.0**
A minimal CLI shopping list with smooth UX and undo/redo.

Commands: type an item to add; use "listar", "desfazer", "refazer"; press ENTER for help; confirm with y/n to continue.

UX: clears the screen after actions and uses typewriter-style prompts.

Logic: two-stack history (undo/redo) with redo cleared after new additions.

---

## Analistic Texts
A console-based tool that analyzes a block of text and displays detailed statistics.

It calculates word count, character count, longest word, and letter frequency, using concepts like string manipulation, functions, loops, and terminal interaction with a typewriter effect.

---

### features

- guess login and password  
- limited attempts with hints  
- clear screen between steps  
- replay option
