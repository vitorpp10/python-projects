<h1 align="center"> Python OOP Projects — Phase 1</h1>

<p align="center">
  A collection of <b>Object-Oriented Python projects</b> built to deepen my understanding of real OOP principles.<br>
  From banking systems to tax calculators — each project applies abstraction, polymorphism, and clean design.

## OOP Projects Overview

### **Bank Simulator**
A complete banking system using classes, encapsulation, and composition to manage accounts, balances, and user actions.  
This project solidified my understanding of object modeling, CLI UX, and modular design.

---

### **Tax Calculator Simulator**
A polymorphism-based product tax system where each product type calculates its own tax rate through abstract and derived classes.  
Built to practice abstraction, polymorphic behavior, and clean OOP architecture following SOLID ideas.
