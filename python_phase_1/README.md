## About this Repository

This repository represents the **first phase** of learning in Python — documenting early projects and a transition toward **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
The goal is to show **clear progression** in code organization, problem-solving, and structure.

It’s designed for:
- A **minimal and readable UX**
- **Quick setup** and execution
- A **simple, scalable structure** as the repository grows

---

## Tracks

### 🔹 Basic Projects
Short, foundational scripts to practice:
- Logic and control flow
- User input/output
- Core data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.)

### 🔸 OOP Projects
Intermediate exercises to explore:
- Classes and objects  
- Encapsulation and clean architecture  
- Reusability and scalability in design

## Getting Started

Run the projects easily using **Python 3.x** and a **virtual environment** for clean isolation and reproducibility.

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-projects.git
cd python-projects/python-phase-1

# Create virtual environment (Windows)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Create virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
▶Run a Project
bash
Copy code
# Example: run a script from the basic_projects folder
python basic_projects/list_market_2_0.py
Roadmap
Next Steps:

Python + SQL: persistence, querying, and small CRUD apps connecting logic with real data

Quality upgrades: unit tests, linting, and packaging for better structure and reliability

CLI/UX polish: clearer messages, consistent flags, and friendly terminal error handling

Learning Status
Currently in continuous practice and exploration, actively improving through feedback and iteration.
Phase 1 exists to demonstrate early progress, while building a foundation for more advanced, intermediate work.


Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Concepts: Procedural Programming, OOP, Data Structures, CLI I/O

Environment: Virtualenv (venv)

Tools (planned): pytest, pylint, SQL (SQLite/PostgreSQL), packaging
